It refers to objects that can be described in multiple ways at the same time. Take my cup of jasmine tea, for instance. It’s a tea in the general sense—it’s brewed by immersing some kind of dried leaf or plant in water. But this is also a jasmine tea, and there are other kinds of teas, like genmaicha and Earl Grey, that each have slightly different preparations. For example, you might infuse the leaves of one kind in the water for longer than another. What’s in this cup is also an iced tea. It’s a liquid; it’s a beverage; it’s a green tea; it’s a Tea Served by This Particular Café; it’s all these things at once. This is what we mean by polymorphism.” “But it just seems like common sense?” “It is! For us humans. But early computer programs had a hard time understanding that. If you told a computer to make jasmine tea, even though you’d already told it how to make Earl Grey, it would’ve been like, ‘Whatchu mean? I don’t know how to do that.’ It wouldn’t know where to start, because it didn’t realize those two things had anything in common. You’d have to explicitly spell out every step for each tea. You’d have to say, ‘Okay computer, go fill a kettle with some water and scoop some tea into a teapot,’ even though you’d already told it to do the exact same thing for a different tea. “With modern programming languages, you can say, ‘Hey computer, here are some common attributes of teas, and regardless of the type of tea, here’s how to make it, and I’ll let you know if there are any exceptions.’ Then you tell it, ‘Look fella, we got some genmaicha here and genmaicha is a tea.

It is quite basic, however, and it’s on a per-page basis, but it’s a good starting point. Typecast Typecast gives you some text to style – headings, paragraphs, lists – and you can just click on an element to change the style. An adjustable baseline grid is included. This makes a great entry point for building a site from the content out, because you can easily paste in your own content and choose from thousands of different fonts. It also outputs a style sheet, generates a style guide, or you can download a PDF. It’s built specifically for the web, so measurements are in pixels and ems. Frontify Frontify allows you to upload screenshots of your design, and pick the main colours to turn into swatches. You can take screenshots of modules and upload the markup for them.

For example, if we pass the mixin the medium-screens variable, Sass will compile the media query with our max-width set to the $width-medium variable (760px).
