        <content>Say no by default If I’d listened to customers,I’d have given them a faster horse. —HENRY FORD It’s so easy to say yes. Yes to another feature, yes to an overly optimistic deadline, yes to a mediocre design. Soon, the stack of things you’ve said yes to grows so tall you can’t even see the things you should really be doing. Start getting into the habit of saying no—even to many of your best ideas. Use the power of no to get your priorities straight. You rarely regret saying no. But you often wind up regretting saying yes.</content>

        <content>Maybe you’ve seen this scenario: There’s a customer that’s paying a company a lot of money. The company tries to please that customer in any way possible. It tweaks and changes the product per this one customer’s requests and starts to alienate its general customer base. Then one day that big customer winds up leaving and the company is left holding the bag—and the bag is a product that’s ideally suited to someone who’s not there anymore. And now it’s a bad fit for everyone else. When you stick with your current customers come hell or high water, you wind up cutting yourself off from new ones. Your product or service becomes so tailored to your current customers that it stops appealing to fresh blood. And that’s how your company starts to die.</content>

        <content>Unfortunately, copying in the business arena is usually more nefarious. Maybe it’s because of the copy-and-paste world we live in these days. You can steal someone’s words, images, or code instantly. And that means it’s tempting to try to build a business by being a copycat. That’s a formula for failure, though. The problem with this sort of copying is it skips understanding—and understanding is how you grow. You have to understand why something works or why something is the way it is. When you just copy and paste, you miss that. You just repurpose the last layer instead of understanding all the layers underneath.</content>

        <content>Vic Firth came up with the idea of making a better drumstick while playing timpani for the Boston Symphony Orchestra. The sticks he could buy commercially didn’t measure up to the job, so he began making and selling drumsticks from his basement at home. Then one day he dropped a bunch of sticks on the floor and heard all the different pitches. That’s when he began to match up sticks by moisture content, weight, density, and pitch so they were identical pairs. The result became his product’s tag line: “the perfect pair.”</content>

        <content>Like most teachers, Langdon did not enjoy being lectured to. The Moses above them had horns for the same reason thousands of Christian images of Moses had horns?a mistranslation of the book of Exodus. The original Hebrew text described Moses as having ?karan ?ohr panav? ??facial skin that glowed with rays of light??but when the Roman Catholic Church created the official Latin translation of the Bible, the translator bungled Moses?s description, rendering it as ?cornuta esset facies sua,? meaning ?his face was horned.? From that moment on, artists and sculptors, fearing reprisals if they were not true to the Gospels, began depicting Moses with horns. ?It was a simple mistake,? Langdon replied. ?A mistranslation by Saint Jerome around four hundred A.D.? Bellamy looked impressed. ?Exactly. A mistranslation. And the result is . . . poor Moses is now misshapen for all history.?</content>

The Almighty God in Genesis was described not as One . . . but as Many. ?God is plural,? Katherine whispered, ?because the minds of man are plural.? Langdon?s thoughts were spiraling now . . . dreams, memories, hopes, fears, revelations . . . all swirling above him in the Rotunda dome.

        <content>In 2001, in the hours following the horrifying events of September 11, the field of Noetic Science made a quantum leap forward. Four scientists discovered that as the frightened world came together and focused in shared grief on this single tragedy, the outputs of thirty-seven different Random Event Generators around the world suddenly became significantly less random. Somehow, the oneness of this shared experience, the coalescing of millions of minds, had affected the randomizing function of these machines, organizing their outputs and bringing order from chaos.</content>

Four scientists discovered that as the frightened world came together and focused in shared grief on this single tragedy, the outputs of thirty-seven different Random Event Generators around the world suddenly became significantly less random. Somehow, the oneness of this shared experience, the coalescing of millions of minds, had affected the randomizing function of these machines, organizing their outputs and bringing order from chaos.</mid>

        <content>?Then don?t think of it as faith. Think of it simply as changing your perspective, accepting that the world is not precisely as you imagine. Historically, every major scientific breakthrough began with a simple idea that threatened to overturn all of our beliefs. The simple statement ?the earth is round? was mocked as utterly impossible because most people believed the oceans would flow off the planet. Heliocentricity was called heresy. Small minds have always lashed out at what they don?t understand. There are those who create . . . and those who tear down. That dynamic has existed for all time. But eventually the creators find believers, and the number of believers reaches a critical mass, and suddenly the world becomes round, or the solar system becomes heliocentric. Perception is transformed, and a new reality is born.?</content>

        <content>There are, however, ways to mitigate things so that labels within input fields work better. The mobile sign-in screen for the project management application Basecamp keeps labels within input fields visible until someone actually begins to enter an answer. (This requires some development work as it currently isn’t default web browser behavior.) Basecamp also makes a stronger visual distinction between answers and labels so the two are less likely to be confused (fig 6.3). Fig 6.3: 37signal’s Basecamp has put in some extra work to make labels within input fields better in their sign-in form. </content>

        <content>For starters, several new HTML5 input types can help people accurately answer questions that require a specific format. On a mobile browser like Safari, specifying an input of type url brings up a virtual alphanumeric keyboard with “.”, “/”, and “.com” keys. Specifying an input of type email brings up a virtual alphanumeric keyboard with “.” and “@” keys. And specifying an input of type number brings up a virtual numeric keyboard (fig 6.10). </content>

        <content>After all, over four billion text messages were sent per day in the United States in 2010—many of them through painful feature phone keypads. Clearly people want to message each other using their mobiles—a lot. And they are willing to endure hardship to do it.</content>

          <pre>But while there are lots of great reasons to avoid requiring precise input when people are just “one eyeball and one thumb,” there are just as many reasons to let people contribute as much as they see fit from their mobile devices. </pre>

        <content>At this point we’ve talked about reasons for designing and developing web experiences for mobile first. A mobile first approach: Prepares you for the explosive growth and new opportunities emerging on mobile today. Forces you to focus and prioritize your products by embracing the constraints inherent in mobile design. Allows you to deliver innovative experiences by building on new capabilities native to mobile devices.</content>

We can use an input mask to “mask” or cover over anything that isn’t part of the format we require.

It felt like we were giving up the thing that made us most unique to be everything to everyone. Though my reservations came from the right place, my concerns about how it would change our brand were wrong. After party pooper mode had been out for over a year, we wondered how many of our users actually turned it on. I was half scared to find out, because if it were a majority, it would be a referendum on the design persona we had painstakingly constructed. As it turns out, only 0.007% of users actually turn on party pooper mode. What we learned is that even though there are a few vocal party poopers who don’t get the MailChimp brand, there are far more people who do get it and love the moments of joy the application brings.

In his first two weeks on the Slow-Carb Diet, he lost 10 pounds and, perhaps more impressive, racked up incredibly unimpressive costs: Total per-week food cost: $37.70 Average per-meal cost: $1.34 And this was including organic grass-fed beef! If he’d eaten a big salad three times a week instead of a few proteins, his weekly cost would have been $31.70. He repeated four meals: BREAKFAST: Egg whites, one whole egg, mixed vegetables, chicken breast LUNCH: Mixed vegetables, peas, spinach (salad) SECOND LUNCH: Chicken thigh, black beans, mixed vegtables DINNER: Beef (or pork), asparagus, pinto beans</content>

        <content>. Is it possible that the arrow of causality is reversed? Example: do people who are naturally ripped and muscular often choose to be sprinters? Yep. 2. Are we mixing up absence and presence? Example: if the claim is that a no-meat diet extends average lifespan 5–15%, is it possible that it is the presence of more vegetables, not the absence of meat, that extends lifespan? It most certainly is. 3. Is it possible that you tested a specific demographic and that other variables are responsible for the difference? Example: if the claim is that yoga improves cardiac health, and the experimental group comprises upper-class folk, is it possible that they are therefore more likely than a control group to eat better food? You bet your downward-dog-posing ass. </content>

        <content>The Slow-Carb Diet— Better Fat-Loss Through Simplicity It is possible to lose 20 pounds of bodyfat in 30 days by optimizing any of three factors: exercise, diet, or a drug/supplement regimen. Twenty pounds for most people means moving down at least two clothing sizes, whether that’s going from a size 14 dress to a size 10 or from an XXL shirt to a large. The waist and hips show an even more dramatic reduction in circumference. By April 6, 2007, as an example, I had cut from nearly 180 pounds to 165 pounds in six weeks, while adding about 10 pounds of muscle, which means I lost approximately 25 pounds of fat. The changes aren’t subtle.</content>

        <content>I suggest potassium, magnesium, and calcium. This diet will cause you to lose excess water, and electrolytes can go along with it. Potassium can be consumed during meals by using a potassium- enriched salt like “Lite Salt” or, my preference, eating extra guacamole with Mexican meals. Avocadoes, the main ingredient in guacamole, contain 60% more potassium than bananas. Avocadoes also contain 75% insoluble fiber, which will help keep you regular. If you prefer pills, 99-milligram tablets with meals will do the trick. Magnesium and calcium are easiest to consume in pill form, and 500 milligrams of magnesium taken prior to bed will also improve sleep.</content>

        <content>Broccoli Green beans Eat as much as you like of the above food items, but keep it simple. Pick three or four meals and repeat them. Almost all restaurants can give you a salad or vegetables in place of french fries, potatoes, or rice. Surprisingly, I have found Mexican food (after swapping out rice for vegetables) to be one of the cuisines most conducive to the Slow-Carb Diet. If you have to pay an extra $1–3 to substitute at a restaurant, consider it your six-pack tax, the nominal fee you pay to be lean. Most people who go on “low”-carbohydrate diets complain of low energy and quit because they consume insufficient calories. A half-cup of rice is 300 calories, whereas a half-cup of spinach is 15 calories! Vegetables are not calorically dense, so it is critical that you add legumes for caloric load.</content>

        <content>. If you need 15 minutes in the sun to trigger a melanin response, 15 minutes is your MED for tanning. More than 15 minutes is redundant and will just result in burning and a forced break from the beach. During this forced break from the beach, let’s assume one week, someone else who heeded his natural 15-minute MED will be able to fit in four more tanning sessions. He is four shades darker, whereas you have returned to your pale pre-beach self. Sad little manatee. In biological systems, exceeding your MED can freeze progress for weeks, even months.</content>

        <content>1. Do I really look like that in underwear? Take digital photos of yourself from the front, back, and side. Wear either underwear or a bathing suit. Not eager to ask a neighbor for a favor? Use a camera with a timer or a computer webcam like the Mac iSight. Put the least flattering “before” photo somewhere you will see it often: the refrigerator, bathroom mirror, dog’s forehead, etc. 2. Do I really eat that? Use a digital camera or camera phone to take photographs of everything you eat for 3–5 days, preferably including at least one weekend day. For sizing, put your hand next to each item or plate in the photographs. For maximum effect, put these photos online for others to see. 3. Who can I get to do this with me? Find at least one person to engage in a friendly competition using either total inches (TI) or bodyfat percentage. Weight is a poor substitute but another option. Use competitive drive, guilt, and fear of humiliation to your advantage. Embrace the stick. The carrot is overrated.</content>

          <mid>1. Do I really look like that in underwear? Take digital photos of yourself from the front, back, and side. Wear either underwear or a bathing suit. Not eager to ask a neighbor for a favor? Use a camera with a timer or a computer webcam like the Mac iSight. Put the least flattering “before” photo somewhere you will see it often: the refrigerator, bathroom mirror, dog’s forehead, etc. 2. Do I really eat that? Use a digital camera or camera phone to take photographs of everything you eat for 3–5 days, preferably including at least one weekend day. For sizing, put your hand next to each item or plate in the photographs. For maximum effect, put these photos online for others to see. 3. Who can I get to do this with me? Find at least one person to engage in a friendly competition using either total inches (TI) or bodyfat percentage. Weight is a poor substitute but another option. Use competitive drive, guilt, and fear of humiliation to your advantage. Embrace the stick. The carrot is overrated.</mid>

        <content>The sequence of Fibonacci numbers is: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ...and it continues infinitely. The sequence is built by starting with 1 and adding 1 to it, giving the result 2. We then take that answer and add it to the previous value, in this case 1. 1 + 2 = 3. The process is repeated so that 2 + 3 = 5, 3 + 5 = 8 and so on: 1 + 1 = 2 1 + 2 = 3 2 + 3 = 5 3 + 5 = 8 5 + 8 = 13 8 + 13 = 21 13 + 21 = 34 The sequence isn’t intrinsically interesting, but it’s easy to remember. The useful part begins when you divide one Fibonacci number by the preceding Fibonacci number. Doing so results in an approximation of the golden ratio (1.618). 1/1 = 1 2/1 = 2 3/2 = 1.5 5/3 = 1.666 8/5 = 1.6 13/8 = 1.625</content>

The useful part begins when you divide one Fibonacci number by the preceding Fibonacci number. Doing so results in an approximation of the golden ratio (1.618). 1/1 = 1 2/1 = 2 3/2 = 1.5 5/3 = 1.666 8/5 = 1.6 13/8 = 1.625</mid>

        <content>Myth: A Text-Only Version Satisfies the Requirement for Equal or Equivalent Access

Not true. Adaptive technology has come a long way, and almost anything on a conventional web page can be made fully or at least partially accessible, with no visible alteration to your layout. (Remember: the work takes place under the hood.) Shuttling disabled visitors off to a text-only site assumes that the color blind can’t see at all, or that those who have limited mobility have no use for images. It also assumes that these users have no interest in shopping on your commerce site or participating in an online discussion forum. In short, the outdated text-only approach helps no one. Not only that, creating and maintaining text-only pages costs far more (and is far less reliable) than simply adding assistive tags and attributes to your site.</content>

        <content>The 62.5% Solution

In 2004, developer Richard Rutter gave the world a 62.5% solution to the problem of the complex math inherent in em-based design (www.clagnut.com/blog/348). 62.5% of the 16px default size is 10px. Set the body to 62.5% and the rest of the math is easy (because it’s based on 10):

body { font-size: 62.5%; }
p { font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.5; }
h1 { font-size: 2.4em; }
In the example above, p text is 12px tall (1.2 x 10px), its line-height is 15px (1.5 x 10px), and h1 headline text is 24px (2.5 x 10px). Easy-peasy!

Using Rutter’s method, you can attain near-pixel-perfect control without running afoul of IE’s unwillingness to scale pixels. Web designers were quick to seize on Rutter’s brilliant idea, and it has become a best practice.</content>

        <content>If Zappos had relied on existing market research or conducted a survey, it could have asked what customers thought they wanted. By building a product instead, albeit a simple one, the company learned much more: 1. It had more accurate data about customer demand because it was observing real customer behavior, not asking hypothetical questions. 2. It put itself in a position to interact with real customers and learn about their needs. For example, the business plan might call for discounted pricing, but how are customer perceptions of the product affected by the discounting strategy? 3. It allowed itself to be surprised when customers behaved in unexpected ways, revealing information Zappos might not have known to ask about. For example, what if customers returned the shoes?</content>

        <content>After that, I couldn't believe that Sam actually got me a present because I honestly thought that the "I love you" was it. But she did get me a present. And for the first time, something nice like that made me smile and not cry. I guess Sam and Patrick went to the same thrift store because their gifts went together. She took me to her room and stood me in front of her dresser, which was covered in a pillowcase with pretty colors. She lifted off the pillowcase, and there I was, standing in my old suit, looking at an old typewriter with a fresh ribbon. Inside the typewriter was a piece of white paper.

On that piece of white paper, Sam wrote, "Write about me sometime." And I typed something back to her, standing right there in her bedroom. I just typed.

"I will."

        <content>Your hierarchy can be steered by the compositional grid. For example, if the important element of your app is a 320 pixels high chart you may decide to break this down into 20 units of 16 pixels each. These could form the baseline of your body text: the line spacing. If you use the 140% suggestion to set your text and line spacing, your body text size could be calculated as 16÷1.4 = 11px. All other components of the typography hierarchy should also align to the 16-pixel baseline grid: for example, a 24-pixel heading with 32 pixels line spacing. </content>

I make the sorts of drawings people produce on the backs of envelopes while on hold with the gas company. There is no subject, just as a good walk has no destination; their purpose is movement. My pencil cuts across the paper like a figure skater zipping around her rink, overlapping, skipping, and spinning. The skater ignores the mark that comes in the wake of her movement, and I do the same. This drawing isn’t aesthetic, it is kinetic  –  more like dancing than drawing.</content>

The skater ignores the mark that comes in the wake of her movement, and I do the same. This drawing isn’t aesthetic, it is kinetic – more like dancing than drawing.</mid>

        <content>Henry Ford famously said that if he had asked his customers what they wanted, they would have said a faster horse. Of course, we know that the faster horse is a testament to the limited imagination of customers, but I’d suggest that it’s more representational of not reassessing the objectives of the work in light of new opportunities. The faster horse is a recombination of the three levers in a predictable way: the customer’s answer is staunchly loyal to the horse, the already established format of transportation. They are inside of the adjacent possible, and ask a How question: How can horses be better?</content>

      <content>Quick read and full of good insight. It was great getting a view into Drew's head and thought process. Josh also did a great job of breaking down the info and getting the right questions in front of Drew. 

If you haven't picked up a copy, head over to execute book.com and grab one. It is well worth it. </content>

It refers to objects that can be described in multiple ways at the same time. Take my cup of jasmine tea, for instance. It’s a tea in the general sense—it’s brewed by immersing some kind of dried leaf or plant in water. But this is also a jasmine tea, and there are other kinds of teas, like genmaicha and Earl Grey, that each have slightly different preparations. For example, you might infuse the leaves of one kind in the water for longer than another. What’s in this cup is also an iced tea. It’s a liquid; it’s a beverage; it’s a green tea; it’s a Tea Served by This Particular Café; it’s all these things at once. This is what we mean by polymorphism.” “But it just seems like common sense?” “It is! For us humans. But early computer programs had a hard time understanding that. If you told a computer to make jasmine tea, even though you’d already told it how to make Earl Grey, it would’ve been like, ‘Whatchu mean? I don’t know how to do that.’ It wouldn’t know where to start, because it didn’t realize those two things had anything in common. You’d have to explicitly spell out every step for each tea. You’d have to say, ‘Okay computer, go fill a kettle with some water and scoop some tea into a teapot,’ even though you’d already told it to do the exact same thing for a different tea. “With modern programming languages, you can say, ‘Hey computer, here are some common attributes of teas, and regardless of the type of tea, here’s how to make it, and I’ll let you know if there are any exceptions.’ Then you tell it, ‘Look fella, we got some genmaicha here and genmaicha is a tea. Go make genmaicha, except don’t boil the water all the way.’</content>

        <content>When debating her next career move, Sandberg made a spreadsheet comparing the roles and responsibilities that would come with each position and company she was considering. Google was on her list (a relatively unknown company in 2001), and ranked lower than all of the other options in categories like security, salary and responsibilities, but when Sandberg presented her dilemma to Eric Schmidt, Google's CEO at the time, he managed to change her mind with this simple piece of advice:"[Eric] covered my spreadsheet with his hand and told me not to be an idiot (also a great piece of advice). </content>

Google was on her list (a relatively unknown company in 2001), and ranked lower than all of the other options in categories like security, salary and responsibilities, but when Sandberg presented her dilemma to Eric Schmidt, Google's CEO at the time, he managed to change her mind with this simple piece of advice:"[Eric] covered my spreadsheet with his hand and told me not to be an idiot (also a great piece of advice). </mid>

        <content>Do you use a computer at all?No, and I prefer it that way. Most designers of my generation are equally technology-challenged. For me, the excitement is doing sketches. My sketches start out being very rough and then get very, very precise. Then I’ll go gather reference, sit with one of my designers and go over it carefully, and supervise the execution of it. We try very hard to make sure things don’t look like they were made on a computer.</content>

        <content>Research interviews rely on the quality and accuracy of their interviewees. One of the challenges of interviewing is mitigating against an interviewee unintentionally but inaccurately describing their own behaviour: self-reporting error. Part of this relates to the interviewing environment you create, and how much you can put your interviewee at ease and able to share openly with you. But watch out for interviewees generalising or using absolutes: “I always…”, “I never…”. Gently challenge these by seeking tangible examples: When, recently, have you done something like that? Can you talk about a time when…?</content>

        <content>Silence is an great tool for interviewers. Chris Noessel, in a piece for Cooper, suggests leaving four seconds of silence after an interviewee has replied, just enough time for them to process what they’ve said and add to it. As Chris says, a tactical sip of water or note-taking avoids you sitting awkwardly staring at the interviewee. Leaving these gaps has another benefit too: helping to avoid a sense of rushing the interview, a chance for you to take a moment to think about where you are in the interview and where to go next.</content>

        <content>When interviewing, always look to drill down into the interviewee’s motivations and behaviours. 5 Whys, a technique originating in Toyota’s production system, is one model for uncovering underlying cause and effect. The initial answer to a question might be only part of the story – asking why again can start to reveal the reasons behind it. When did you last buy music online? I don’t buy music online. Why do you think that might be? I rarely see something I want. Why is that? Well, I used to buy albums, but find I just pick out individual tracks these days. How do you go about finding those tracks? I listen to 6music and then find and favourite them on Spotify.</content>

        <content>Lorenzo de’ Medici—known in his day as Lorenzo the Magnificent on account of his benevolence—was an accomplished artist and poet in his own right and was said to have a superb eye. In 1489 Lorenzo took a liking to the work of a young Florentine sculptor and invited the boy to move into the Medici palace, where he could practice his craft surrounded by fine art, great poetry, and high culture. Under Medici tutelage, the adolescent boy flourished and eventually went on to carve two of the most celebrated sculptures in all of history—the Pietà and the David.

When the device was agitated, a metal ball inside sailed back and forth across a series of paddles and powered a tiny generator.

      <content>Great read as usual from Dan Brown. The only thing that bugged me about this novel is that I was able to guess several major plot elements. My favorite thing about this previous books is just the opposite - plot twists are impossible to predict. 

Still worth a read. </content>

        <content>The other advice is to focus on one thing. I see a lot of entrepreneurs build something and then move onto the next thing and the next thing and the next. Building something is only step one. It's not that hard to put something out there. Building on top of that to maintain and improve it is actually the harder thing to do. Anyone can release something, but it's much harder to polish and refine it over time once it's out there.</content>

        <content>I'm more of a fan of constant, steady growth because it feels more sustainable over a long period of time. Creating things that are lasting is what great cultures do. When you travel in Europe and see structures that have been around for hundreds of years, you think, "This culture cared to make something that would last forever." What are we creating today that's going to last for 20, 50, or 100 years?</content>

        <content>In a talk she gave about working with real estate business Trulia, Nicole Sullivan highlighted the importance of building a living style guide to improve the performance of front-end code. By auditing all the components on the site, she was able to spot style duplications in the CSS and design inconsistencies (these are quite common when sites grow organically). After refactoring the code, she had reduced the HTML by 48%, removed 135Kb of unused CSS, and made load time 21% faster.</content>

        <content>You might already have the foundation of a front-end style guide in the form of a reset style sheet. Create a basic HTML page with all the relevant text elements on it and you can check that your basic typography looks good. If you don’t use one, a great place to start is Typecast. Here you can style text, change the typeface, adjust the font size, and see how it looks in the browser. You can style specific elements like lists, and you can output it all as CSS.</content>

        <content>Some clients will immediately get it, others won’t. For those that don’t, Clearleft found it helps to make element collages that they’ve created look less like a webpage by changing the format slightly. “[Jon Aizlewood] soon realised that by presenting these elements together vertically, some stakeholders mistook the output for a web page. He is now using a long, wide horizontal canvas to mitigate against this. He’s also scaling up certain elements, so that the discussion revolves around the overall visual aesthetic, rather than the pixel precision and font sizing of certain components.” — Paul Lloyd, “Visual Design Explorations”, (8 March 2013)</content>

        <content>Stylify Me Stylify Me is an online style guide generator. Simply add your page URL and it will spit out the main colours and typefaces used. This is perfect when you need to kick-start a style guide for an existing site. It includes image dimensions, swatches, typefaces and a screenshot of the page. It is quite basic, however, and it’s on a per-page basis, but it’s a good starting point. Typecast Typecast gives you some text to style – headings, paragraphs, lists – and you can just click on an element to change the style. An adjustable baseline grid is included. This makes a great entry point for building a site from the content out, because you can easily paste in your own content and choose from thousands of different fonts. It also outputs a style sheet, generates a style guide, or you can download a PDF. It’s built specifically for the web, so measurements are in pixels and ems. Frontify Frontify allows you to upload screenshots of your design, and pick the main colours to turn into swatches. You can take screenshots of modules and upload the markup for them. However, it doesn’t generate the module itself from the markup</content>

        <content>Combining @content blocks and mixins By using Sass’s @content directive, you can pass entire blocks of styles to a mixin, and Sass will place those blocks back into the declaration that calls the mixin. That sounds confusing, but in practice it’s simple and handy. Let’s create a responsive mixin that handles three different breakpoints, with @content placeholders for whatever styles we’d like to include for each breakpoint. We’ll also use variables to define the small, medium, and large breakpoint widths as we did earlier in the chapter. $width-small: 400px; $width-medium: 760px; $width-large: 1200px; @mixin responsive($width) { @if $width == wide-screens { @media only screen and (max-width: $width-large) { @content; } } @else if $width == medium-screens { @media only screen and (max-width: $width-medium) { @content; } } @else if $width == small-screens { @media only screen and (max-width: $width-small) { @content; } } } Notice Sass also supports @if and @else statements, which we’re using to evaluate the $width variable we’ll pass when including the mixin. For example, if we pass the mixin the medium-screens variable, Sass will compile the media query with our max-width set to the $width-medium variable (760px). The @content placeholder allows us to further pass blocks of styles to the mixin that get inserted inside the media query. With this single mixin set up, we can now call it from any declaration using a compact pattern that reflects the way we think about things:</content>

        <content>Using variables for style guides Jina Bolton wrote a great article on how Sass variables can help with creating a style guide from a brand palette (http://bkaprt.com/sass/10/). Says Jina: To keep our style guide relevant, it lives in our internal-only admin section on the very same application it describes. We display our color palette alongside the relevant Sass variables and since we’ve built the style guide into the application using the same front-end, we can use the same variables we’re referencing to render this palette. When we change values to these variables, the palette updates automatically (Fig 3.2). FIG 3.2: Jina Bolton uses Sass to help create style guides.</content>

        <content>Mixin arguments Sass mixins can also take arguments that we pass to the mixin when we call it. For example, let’s add an argument for specifying a color along with our title-style mixin. Specify arguments with variables inside parentheses when defining the mixin: @mixin title-style($color) { margin: 0 0 20px 0; font-family: $font-serif; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; text-transform: uppercase; color: $color; } When calling the mixin, we can now pass a color to it (here a lovely burnt orange), along with the other rules: section.main h2 { @include title-style(#c63); }</content>

        <content>First, we’ll define a mixin in Sass using the @mixin directive at the top of the .scss file. I’ll name it title-style, and I’ll define the rules for margins and fonts: @mixin title-style { margin: 0 0 20px 0; font-family: $font-serif; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; text-transform: uppercase; } Once it’s defined, we can now refer to this mixin anywhere we’d like to insert those styles by using the @include directive. On the Sasquatch site, we have a section of the stylesheet that defines rules for the page’s main section, and we want the mixin to style all &lt;h2&gt; elements: section.main h2 { @include title-style; } This will compile to: section.main h2 { margin: 0 0 20px 0; font-family: Jubilat, Georgia, serif; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; text-transform: uppercase; } But we also want to style &lt;h3&gt; elements in the sidebar the exact same way. So, later in the stylesheet we can call the same mixin, which will compile the same rules: section.secondary h3 { @include title-style; } This lets us avoid duplicating the shared styles—or adding a class to the markup that both headings could theoretically share.</content>

          <mid>First, we’ll define a mixin in Sass using the @mixin directive at the top of the .scss file. I’ll name it title-style, and I’ll define the rules for margins and fonts: @mixin title-style { margin: 0 0 20px 0; font-family: $font-serif; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; text-transform: uppercase; } Once it’s defined, we can now refer to this mixin anywhere we’d like to insert those styles by using the @include directive. On the Sasquatch site, we have a section of the stylesheet that defines rules for the page’s main section, and we want the mixin to style all &lt;h2&gt; elements: section.main h2 { @include title-style; } This will compile to: section.main h2 { margin: 0 0 20px 0; font-family: Jubilat, Georgia, serif; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; text-transform: uppercase; } But we also want to style &lt;h3&gt; elements in the sidebar the exact same way. So, later in the stylesheet we can call the same mixin, which will compile the same rules: section.secondary h3 { @include title-style; } This lets us avoid duplicating the shared styles—or adding a class to the markup that both headings could theoretically share.</mid>

        <content>Using placeholder selectors with @extend What if the class you’re extending exists solely for the purpose of extending other styles? In other words, you might create a class that’s not used on its own. Enter placeholder selectors, which allow you to define “phantom” classes that won’t appear in the outputted CSS on their own. You can reference placeholders using @extend. Let’s take a look at this in practice. We’ll create a class for a block of styles that define a button. We’ll use a placeholder selector, which in Sass means prefixing the class name with a % instead of a period. %button { padding: 10px; font-weight: bold; background: blue; border-radius: 6px; } We can call this rule set in other classes as we did previously, using @extend. .buy { @extend %button; } .submit { @extend %button; background: green; } Sass will compile this like an extended class, but the %button placeholder rule set won’t appear in the output: .buy, .submit { padding: 10px; font-weight: bold; background: blue; border-radius: 6px; } .submit { background: green; }</content>

        <content>Going a step further, you can also define an entire media query as a variable (not just the numeric value): $mobile-first: "screen and (min-width: 300px)"; @media #{$mobile-first} { #content { font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5; } } Notice the interpolation brackets—#{}—surrounding the $mobile-first variable. That’s a special way to alert Sass to compile something within a selector or property name.

For example, let’s say we style paragraphs in the main section of the site, but we want a slightly different style on a specific page.

        <content>For example, consider the JavaScript switch statement. It’s a very common error to mistakenly allow one case to fall through into another, such as this: switch(value) { case 1: doSomething(); case 2: doSomethingElse(); break; default: doDefaultThing(); } The first case falls through into the second case so if value is 1, then both doSomething() and doSomethingElse() are executed. And here’s the question: is there an error here? It’s possible that the developer forgot to include a break in the first case, but it’s also equally possible that the developer intended for the first case to fall through to the second case. There’s no way to tell just from looking at the code. Now suppose you have a JavaScript style guide that says something like this:</content>

        <content>Finally, you should never combine the two. If a class does a specific job, it should have an equally explicit name (e.g. .user-profile_name rather than .name). Takeaway: Make sure the names you use for selectors are appropriate, and that they expose as much information as they can. Do not worry about being long-winded with classes (I recently wrote a class of .accordion__trigger--closed), and name them so that other developers will find them practical and sensible to work with.</content>

        <content>Opening the Chrome developer tools revealed two things: first, the HTML of the button was the following: &lt;a class="button eula-download-button" href="javascript:void(0)" data-g-label="download chrome" data-g-event="cta"&gt; … &lt;/a&gt; Second, the error console greeted you with “TypeError: chrm.download is undefined.” What happened? Well, something in the JavaScript went wrong and took the button with it. javascript:void(0) is not a valid URL and has no business being in an href attribute. It is a blinking warning sign that somewhere in the development process Google threw in the towel and created everything in JavaScript. On investigation, I found out that the purpose of the code is to show an end user license agreement before download (as hinted in the class name), and the JavaScript automatically detects the operating system to provide the appropriate install package for Chrome. Both very good uses for this page, but the way they were implemented meant Google lost half a day of Chrome downloads. The remedy is straightforward: instead of pointing the link to a small inline JavaScript that does nothing at all, it should point to a download page that lists all the downloadable versions of Chrome. This could be a great resource in any case, as sometimes I might want to download a version not for my OS (for example, if I am on a fast connection somewhere). You can still add an event handler to the link to do all the other necessary things done in the JavaScript that was never called.</content>

        <content>All switch statement cases must end with break, throw, return, or a comment indicating a fall-through. Judging by this guideline, there is definitely a stylistic error and that means there could be a logic error. If the first case was supposed to fall through to the second case, then it should look like this: switch(value) { case 1: doSomething(); // falls through case 2: doSomethingElse(); break; default: doDefaultThing(); } If the first case wasn’t supposed to fall through, then it should end with a statement such as break.

When a browser fails to play a video, it fires an error handler on the last source element in the video element. So, we test that the browser understands addEventListener() and querySelector() (which is the standard way of jQuery’s $(), really) and then get the last source element in the video element. If there is an error event being fired, we create a div element and replace the video with that one.</content>

There’s no perfect solution for avoiding interruptions in requestAnimationFrame callbacks, but you can get some mileage using CSS animations to remove the need for them.

        <content>TL;DR You can't pick a winner until you decide how you're keeping score. A/B testing starts with determining quantifiable success metrics. There are a number of possible conversion goals: time on site, pageviews, average order value, revenue per visitor, and so on. Take the time to pick the one that's right for you. Site analytics along with your own instincts will suggest bottlenecks where you can focus your attention. Understanding visitor intent with the help of interviews and usability tests will suggest hypotheses about what to change and how. Prioritize your experiments based on your prediction of their impact. Start testing, and continue until you begin to see diminishing returns.</content>

Over the course of the campaign, that 40.6 percent lift in signups translated to 2.8 million more email subscribers, 288,000 more volunteers, and—perhaps most important of all—an additional $57 million in donations.</content>
