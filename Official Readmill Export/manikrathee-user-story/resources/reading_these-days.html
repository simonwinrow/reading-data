She had set him up and he was to follow through. The words came perfectly naturally and without thinking, as if he were merely the conduit for things that were meant to be heard. “In that case, we should get acquainted over lunch,” he said. “I happen to know of this great little Swedish place around the corner.

It refers to objects that can be described in multiple ways at the same time. Take my cup of jasmine tea, for instance. It’s a tea in the general sense—it’s brewed by immersing some kind of dried leaf or plant in water. But this is also a jasmine tea, and there are other kinds of teas, like genmaicha and Earl Grey, that each have slightly different preparations. For example, you might infuse the leaves of one kind in the water for longer than another. What’s in this cup is also an iced tea. It’s a liquid; it’s a beverage; it’s a green tea; it’s a Tea Served by This Particular Café; it’s all these things at once. This is what we mean by polymorphism.” “But it just seems like common sense?” “It is! For us humans. But early computer programs had a hard time understanding that. If you told a computer to make jasmine tea, even though you’d already told it how to make Earl Grey, it would’ve been like, ‘Whatchu mean? I don’t know how to do that.’ It wouldn’t know where to start, because it didn’t realize those two things had anything in common. You’d have to explicitly spell out every step for each tea. You’d have to say, ‘Okay computer, go fill a kettle with some water and scoop some tea into a teapot,’ even though you’d already told it to do the exact same thing for a different tea. “With modern programming languages, you can say, ‘Hey computer, here are some common attributes of teas, and regardless of the type of tea, here’s how to make it, and I’ll let you know if there are any exceptions.’ Then you tell it, ‘Look fella, we got some genmaicha here and genmaicha is a tea. Go make genmaicha, except don’t boil the water all the way.’</p>

He heard the lapping of cars outside, waves upon waves of rubber on asphalt, sounds carried like scents up the side of the building by the breeze off a concrete sea.
