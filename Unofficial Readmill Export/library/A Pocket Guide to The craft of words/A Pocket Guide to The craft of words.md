**A Pocket Guide to The craft of words** by *The Standardistas*

A collection of evocative words that establish your brand’s personality, a word bank helps to establish a clear tone and voice. Think of it as a moodboard for words. The words you choose, as Shaw highlights, while functionally similar, are emotionally distinct: Start or begin? Purchase or buy? Complete or finish? Identifying word flavours helps to define tone and voice, and can pave the way towards the development of a brand dictionary, encapsulating the language of your design. Consider two examples: smart and Mercedes-Benz (both, coincidentally, owned by the same parent company, Daimler AG). Both create compact cars, both position themselves differently, thanks in a large part to the words they use.

The results are memorable, iconic expressions – carefully designed phrases – that live on, long after the products are gone. Apple: “1,000 songs in your pocket.” The competition: “A large storage capacity and a compact design.” We all know the product.

Companies like Apple eschew technical terminology in favour of language that connects with users at a deep, emotional level. Where others might focus on technical specifications, bombarding users with a barrage of dull facts, Apple embraces a more human approach.

At both levels – macro and micro – words can, when used in a considered manner as a part of the design process (indeed as another, core design element), aid and improve the user experience leaving users delighted and happy.
