**A Pocket Guide to Interviewing for research** by *Andrew Travers*

Let interviewees find their voice, don’t box them in with a constraining interview format, but find the way to let them their own story.

Focus less on formal deliverables and more on storytelling, on painting a fuller picture of the interviewees and their needs both for your fellow designers and your client.

Research manager Nina Belk describes how, in one project, she chose to limit findings to short end-of-day email summaries to the project’s management and stakeholders, with selected highlights and key findings. For Nina and for her employers, it proved an incredibly viral way of sharing insight – insight the business had already gained elsewhere, but here made usable and easily shareable – by email rather than lying hidden, long forgotten, in a slide deck.

Silence is an great tool for interviewers. Chris Noessel, in a piece for Cooper, suggests leaving four seconds of silence after an interviewee has replied, just enough time for them to process what they’ve said and add to it. As Chris says, a tactical sip of water or note-taking avoids you sitting awkwardly staring at the interviewee. Leaving these gaps has another benefit too: helping to avoid a sense of rushing the interview, a chance for you to take a moment to think about where you are in the interview and where to go next.

Leading questions proffer the answer within the question; closed questions suggest yes or no answers; both close down the space the interviewee has to answer. Loading: You don’t buy music online, do you? Closed: Have you bought music online within the last fourteen days? Open: Can you tell me about a time recently when you’ve bought music online? Avoid offering an answer in your question. “Would it be better if there was an app for that?”

Research interviews rely on the quality and accuracy of their interviewees. One of the challenges of interviewing is mitigating against an interviewee unintentionally but inaccurately describing their own behaviour: self-reporting error. Part of this relates to the interviewing environment you create, and how much you can put your interviewee at ease and able to share openly with you. But watch out for interviewees generalising or using absolutes: “I always…”, “I never…”. Gently challenge these by seeking tangible examples: When, recently, have you done something like that? Can you talk about a time when…?

When interviewing, always look to drill down into the interviewee’s motivations and behaviours. 5 Whys, a technique originating in Toyota’s production system, is one model for uncovering underlying cause and effect. The initial answer to a question might be only part of the story – asking why again can start to reveal the reasons behind it. When did you last buy music online? I don’t buy music online. Why do you think that might be? I rarely see something I want. Why is that? Well, I used to buy albums, but find I just pick out individual tracks these days. How do you go about finding those tracks? I listen to 6music and then find and favourite them on Spotify.

---

it can be tempting to overscript your interview questions in an attempt to be precise with your wording and remove any room for error. It’s tempting but it’s also a mistake. The best interviews find their own flow, and your questions need to go with it.

---

vital to spend time up-front discussing and planning the research activity, to determine: The expectations for the research: what’s the design problem you are investigating? How the findings from the research will be used: understanding the audience for the research – whether that’s an organisation’s leadership, or its design team – and what they’ll do with it, should determine the best format to deliver your findings. How and when the research will be conducted: the format (and formality) of the research, be it guerrilla or in a formal lab environment. Who you need to talk to, inside and outside of the organisation.
