Nowadays, I'm working 4-day weeks, and doing no more than an hour or two of intense work at a time. I take a lot of walks. I've lost weight. I'm happier. My wife is happier. I'm more present. And most importantly:I'm doing the best work of my life.

Paradoxically, the more I let go, the more things seemed to take off. Short workdays forced me to focus on the important stuff instead of dicking around in my inbox, and I quickly learned to delegate the day-to-day. I started working smart instead of working hard.

We often hear of the benefits of working less: our body is naturally wired to work in short bursts and when we give our mind room to breathe we generate new ideas and connections.
