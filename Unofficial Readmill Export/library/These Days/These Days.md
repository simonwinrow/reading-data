**These Days** by *Jack Cheng*

He placed his hand on the laptop and slid his thumb to the edge of the lid, and he was ready to make the first cut. He closed his eyes and listened. He heard the lapping of cars outside, waves upon waves of rubber on asphalt, sounds carried like scents up the side of the building by the breeze off a concrete sea. He inhaled the morning air through the windows and opened his eyes.

The prospect of being able to work on real technologies, to invent the future instead of stand on the sidelines and react as it zoomed by, was captivating. Connor’s heart raced and his knee bounced even faster. They hadn’t even discussed salary, but he didn’t care. He would have done it without pay. A guy who looked like he was still in high school casually strolled past their table, uncapped a marker dangling from a string by the ship calendar, and signed his name in one of the boxes. Connor looked back at Kaz, who was still staring directly at him from across the table and seemingly hadn’t moved an inch. “When do I start?” Connor asked.

“We all share a common belief, Connor. We believe that much of the suffering and inequality in this world come from an imbalance or inefficiency of information. And if there’s one thing technology does well, it’s eliminate inefficiencies.”

He speaks clearly, steadily, and with purpose.

“Real artists ship,” the man repeated. “It’s something Steve would say. What he meant was that everyone has ideas, but it’s only through putting work out into the world that a truly creative individual can effect change.

---

“Sounds interesting,” Connor said, his default response for something he didn’t yet fully understand.

“What’s the name mean, exactly?” Connor asked. “I heard it’s some kind of programming term?” “You got it. Poly. Polymorph. Polymorphism. It refers to objects that can be described in multiple ways at the same time. Take my cup of jasmine tea, for instance. It’s a tea in the general sense—it’s brewed by immersing some kind of dried leaf or plant in water. But this is also a jasmine tea, and there are other kinds of teas, like genmaicha and Earl Grey, that each have slightly different preparations. For example, you might infuse the leaves of one kind in the water for longer than another. What’s in this cup is also an iced tea. It’s a liquid; it’s a beverage; it’s a green tea; it’s a Tea Served by This Particular Café; it’s all these things at once. This is what we mean by polymorphism.” “But it just seems like common sense?” “It is! For us humans. But early computer programs had a hard time understanding that. If you told a computer to make jasmine tea, even though you’d already told it how to make Earl Grey, it would’ve been like, ‘Whatchu mean? I don’t know how to do that.’ It wouldn’t know where to start, because it didn’t realize those two things had anything in common. You’d have to explicitly spell out every step for each tea. You’d have to say, ‘Okay computer, go fill a kettle with some water and scoop some tea into a teapot,’ even though you’d already told it to do the exact same thing for a different tea. “With modern programming languages, you can say, ‘Hey computer, here are some common attributes of teas, and regardless of the type of tea, here’s how to make it, and I’ll let you know if there are any exceptions.’ Then you tell it, ‘Look fella, we got some genmaicha here and genmaicha is a tea. Go make genmaicha, except don’t boil the water all the way.’

“I had a choice between a certain misery and an uncertain happiness,” it said. “I chose uncertainty.”

It was all so ridiculous, that a group of human beings could spend so much time and energy on something so trivial. Was this what it meant to be an adult these days? Did our ancestors stand around in caves arguing over whether the antlers on the drawing of the deer should have twelve or fourteen points? No, of course not. They were too busy throwing spears at stuff and running from lions and trying not to die. They were out doing real things, expressing their humanity as if their lives depended on it, because their lives did depend on it.

“But there will be other doors,” he reassured her. “And other signs. It’s kind of like how your hair grows and grows and then one day you think, ‘Hey, I need a haircut,’ even though the day before everything was perfectly fine. We don’t realize that our bodies are changing all the time because of how slowly everything moves.” “Maybe every time you make a realization like that, you become a different person,” she said. “Like, those realizations are the inflection points. And then you get the haircut.”

---

“What kind do you want?” he shouted toward the French doors. “Surprise me!” she said. He chose a Rioja with the word RESERVA etched on the label in loosely spaced golden serifs.

---

It wasn’t until Cici waved goodbye to everyone and sidled out of the bar that K finally joined him. Her cheeks were rosy and her eyes were full of stars. She pressed her body into his shoulder, then stole the glass from between his fingers, took a sip of the leggy purple nectar, and smiled. “Welcome to my life,” she said.

---

Stress-free freedom.

Stress-free freedom.

It was probably nothing. It was probably just the combination of the wine and the wind and the way the fading red lights reminded her of the days when she had not yet seen how cruel the circumstances of life could be to any one person.

And he did forget about her—for a whole twelve seconds before he pulled his phone out and started researching recently opened Italian restaurants in the East Village. He narrowed down the list and bookmarked a handful, and then he chuckled and shook his head at himself. You’ve got it bad, Connor.

And as she leaned in and told him about her impending move to Thailand and the non-profit she would be working for, about how she still had endless amounts of packing to do, it occurred to him how strangely wonderful it was that once you had become intimate with someone, your sense of personal space around them stayed indelibly altered, even long after deeper emotional bonds had been severed. Legs could press against each other without any discomfort, eyes could be gazed into without a blink, and waists could be held as one leaned in close for the exchange of new gossip and old jokes.

And that, in essence, brings us to the paradox of Gen Y. They want to stay connected but they want to get away.

Sometimes it’s about what you choose not to read,” she said. “Every book we read or movie we see, every little experience becomes a part of who we are. If we’re all watching the same things and reading the same things and listening to the same things, then our conversations would end up going in circles, reaffirming things we already know and agree about. There would be no surprises, no serendipity. It’d be like this big tragic echo chamber. It’s just not for me. I don’t want to be that hipster girl that lives off the L

“How have you changed since you were younger?” “I’m a lot less naive, and slightly better dressed.” She smiled.

HE WAS PROUD OF HIS INBOX. While colleagues were drowning in unread messages, junk newsletters, and office-wide threads that came back from the dead like trick birthday candles, Connor had mastered the art of the unsubscribe, perfected the alchemy of vague reply to actionable item, attained the zen of synching appointments, to-dos, and reminders across laptop, tablet, and phone. 

---

You could tell a lot about a person by where they put things in their kitchen cupboards. Some were reckless with their arrangements, grouping like objects together without consideration of much other than size and appearance. Connor, on the other hand, had organized his cupboards by activity. Pots and pans were adjacent to the stove and underneath the door for the spices, all within easy reach when preparing a meal, usually pasta. Wineglasses were immediately above the wine rack on the counter, which was directly above the drawer containing the wine opener.

BEFORE HE MOVED to New York, Connor never gave much thought to what lay on the insides of city blocks. He assumed they were solid building—brick, wood, and glass running from facade to facade.

---

She tucked the Kingsolver under her arm and reached out with the other. “K,” she said. “What’s that short for?” “Not short for anything,” she said. “Just the letter. One letter. K.”

---

He pointed to a ring on her bicep. “What about this one?” “We’ve only just met,” she said with a glint in her eye. “I’m not about to tell a stranger my entire life story.” There was a time when Connor would’ve been at a loss for words at a moment like this, when he would’ve retreated to some nervous gesture or apologetic remark, but after leaving the Midwest for New York when he graduated from college, and after a few years of meeting people at bars and parties, he’d come to understand how the whole thing worked. She had set him up and he was to follow through. The words came perfectly naturally and without thinking, as if he were merely the conduit for things that were meant to be heard. “In that case, we should get acquainted over lunch,” he said. “I happen to know of this great little Swedish place around the corner. Their meatballs are phenomenal.”

---

She enunciated the last word with a particular delight. Den-dro-cro-no-lo-gee.

---

They’re like tree rings,” she said. “They mark significant memories in my life. It’s my own personal dendrochronology.”

---

“Those tattoos on your arm—people must ask you about them all the time.” “It would appear so,” she said as her eyes came up to meet his. “And that’s quite a self-aware compliment.” “A what?” “A self-aware compliment,” she said. “You ever notice how people can’t give a straight compliment these days? Instead of saying, ‘I like your necklace’ or ‘You look like a young Ingrid Bergman,’ they say, ‘That necklace is quite a conversation starter’ or ‘I bet a lot of people tell you you look like Ingrid Bergman.’ ” 

---

She laughed. It was a remarkable laugh—coated in honey, starting from the gut and transforming into a shorter, higher-pitched jingle.

For the hungry and foolish
