When you’re married and providing for your spouse, it’s not a good idea to go into debt, but I took out a big loan to buy all my gear and equipment after I quit my full-time gig. It was a big risk, but there’s something I’m really drawn to about risk. I love the moment of standing on the edge of a cliff and just jumping. I’ve always been drawn to that feeling, to that moment, and I’m not afraid of it.

When I got my first travel shoot, I realized, “Wow! I get to travel. I get to go to awesome places, meet awesome people, and use really cool tools.” That was part of the “aha” moment—I realized that photography allowed me to get away from my desk and see the world and that was certainly part of what I liked about it.

I love reading what smart people write. I hate trying to find what smart people have written.
