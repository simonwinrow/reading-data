**Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS** by *Jonathan Snook*

I highly recommended that you specify a body background. Some users may define their own background as something other than white. If you work off the expectation that the background will be white, your design may look broken. Worse, your font colour choice may clash with the userâ€™s setting and make your site unusable.

For State rules, I like is- as in is-hidden or is-collapsed. This helps describe things in a very readable way.
