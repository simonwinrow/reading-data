**The Perks of Being a Wallflower** by *Stephen Chbosky*

After that, I couldn't believe that Sam actually got me a present because I honestly thought that the "I love you" was it. But she did get me a present. And for the first time, something nice like that made me smile and not cry. I guess Sam and Patrick went to the same thrift store because their gifts went together. She took me to her room and stood me in front of her dresser, which was covered in a pillowcase with pretty colors. She lifted off the pillowcase, and there I was, standing in my old suit, looking at an old typewriter with a fresh ribbon. Inside the typewriter was a piece of white paper.

On that piece of white paper, Sam wrote, "Write about me sometime." And I typed something back to her, standing right there in her bedroom. I just typed.

"I will."

"Are you seeing anything, Charlie?"

"Light."

"Does it feel good?"

"Uh-huh."

"Are you thirsty?"

"Uh-huh."

"What would you like to drink?"

"A milkshake."

And everyone in the room, except Sam, erupted in laughter.

"I feel infinite."

---

"Charlie, we accept the love we think we deserve."

---

And I wonder if anyone is really happy. I hope they are. I really hope they are.

She just looked at me and shook her head. Then, she put her arm around my shoulder and walked me down the hallway. We met Patrick outside because they didn't like to go to class sometimes. They preferred to smoke.

"How about your favorite book?"

" This Side of Paradise by From. Scott Fitzgerald."

"Why?"

"Because it was the last one I read."

---

Oh, incidentally, my sister asked for her "Autumn Leaves" mix tape back. She listens to it all the time now.
