**A/B Testing** by *Dan Siroker, Pete Koomen, Cara Harshman*

TL;DR You can't pick a winner until you decide how you're keeping score. A/B testing starts with determining quantifiable success metrics. There are a number of possible conversion goals: time on site, pageviews, average order value, revenue per visitor, and so on. Take the time to pick the one that's right for you. Site analytics along with your own instincts will suggest bottlenecks where you can focus your attention. Understanding visitor intent with the help of interviews and usability tests will suggest hypotheses about what to change and how. Prioritize your experiments based on your prediction of their impact. Start testing, and continue until you begin to see diminishing returns.

Obama told the packed auditorium. “I think that many of you can help me, so I want you to be involved.” He probably meant that he wanted donations, or maybe votes, but I took him literally. I took a leave of absence from Google initially and eventually quit my job to move from California to Chicago to join the campaign.
