Your hierarchy can be steered by the compositional grid. For example, if the important element of your app is a 320 pixels high chart you may decide to break this down into 20 units of 16 pixels each. These could form the baseline of your body text: the line spacing. If you use the 140% suggestion to set your text and line spacing, your body text size could be calculated as 16÷1.4 = 11px. All other components of the typography hierarchy should also align to the 16-pixel baseline grid: for example, a 24-pixel heading with 32 pixels line spacing.
