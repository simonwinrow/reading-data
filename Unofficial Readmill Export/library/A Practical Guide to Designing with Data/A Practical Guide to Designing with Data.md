The sequence of Fibonacci numbers is: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ...and it continues infinitely. The sequence is built by starting with 1 and adding 1 to it, giving the result 2. We then take that answer and add it to the previous value, in this case 1. 1 + 2 = 3. The process is repeated so that 2 + 3 = 5, 3 + 5 = 8 and so on: 1 + 1 = 2 1 + 2 = 3 2 + 3 = 5 3 + 5 = 8 5 + 8 = 13 8 + 13 = 21 13 + 21 = 34 The sequence isn’t intrinsically interesting, but it’s easy to remember. The useful part begins when you divide one Fibonacci number by the preceding Fibonacci number. Doing so results in an approximation of the golden ratio (1.618). 1/1 = 1 2/1 = 2 3/2 = 1.5 5/3 = 1.666 8/5 = 1.6 13/8 = 1.625

The golden ratio is often expressed as the value 1.618, but it is actually infinite. In ordinary use, this means that for every single unit of height, you need 1.618 units of width.

The golden ratio is a specific ratio between two lines of unequal length. The ratio is golden when you get the same value dividing the smaller into the larger as you do when you divide the larger into the sum of both. The equation is: a/b = (a+b)/a
