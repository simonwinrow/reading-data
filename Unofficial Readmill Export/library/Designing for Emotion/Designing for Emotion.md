**Designing for Emotion** by *Aarron Walter*

We’re not just designing pages. We’re designing human experiences. Like the visionaries of the Arts and Crafts movement, we know that preserving the human touch and showing ourselves in our work isn’t optional: it’s essential.

I’ll be honest with you: on principle, I was opposed to creating party pooper mode to appease occasional complaints. It felt like we were giving up the thing that made us most unique to be everything to everyone. Though my reservations came from the right place, my concerns about how it would change our brand were wrong. After party pooper mode had been out for over a year, we wondered how many of our users actually turned it on. I was half scared to find out, because if it were a majority, it would be a referendum on the design persona we had painstakingly constructed. As it turns out, only 0.007% of users actually turn on party pooper mode. What we learned is that even though there are a few vocal party poopers who don’t get the MailChimp brand, there are far more people who do get it and love the moments of joy the application brings. In my opinion, that’s well worth a little risk

If people complain about how your product, service, or brand are unlike your competitors’, then you’re doing something right (so long as they’re not complaining about service quality, reliability, etc.). The people who don’t understand you will come around as the passion for your brand increases. Certain people just need others’ validation before they can fall in love with a product or service.

Emotional engagement can help us look past even the most serious infractions, leaving the good more prominent in our mind than the bad. Psychologists call this phenomenon of positive recollection the rosy effect. As time passes, memories of inconveniences and transgressions fade, leaving only positive memories to shape our perceptions.

Ask your users open-ended questions that will give you the insights you seek. You might ask things like: Describe your initial reactions to the website. How does the website make you feel? If this website were a person, who would it be and why? Would you recommend this site to a friend? Why or why not? Are there site sections or features that are more important to you than others? Less important? Why?

Once your files are in Dropbox, and you’ve shared them with friends, the cost of canceling is higher than continuing to use the service. Call it bribery, call it game theory. The result is the same. Users feel a sense of accomplishment when they’ve completed the required tasks (fig 5.4), and with more free space, they’re excited to drop more stuff into Dropbox.

There was no way for us to know when this greeting would be most appropriate, but that’s not Kate’s perception. Because this greeting so perfectly coincided with her real life, it seemed to Kate that a real person was sitting behind the scenes talking to her directly. In this situation, the application had transformed from a mindless block of code into a living, breathing personality able to forge a human connection. To Kate, it felt like real human-to-human communication.

---

As we experimented with the greetings, we introduced some that referenced specific user traits. We were hoping, like a Vegas casino boss playing the odds, that sooner or later a targeted greeting would land on just the right person, and the influence would intensify. One greeting commented on the user’s haircut, which drew some mystified tweets when we displayed it at just the right time (fig 4.10).

When rewards like the funny little greetings arrive on a regular schedule, with varying degrees of delight, it inspires curiosity in people to see what the next reward will be. Maybe the next one will be really great? I’ve got to go see! This is a psychological phenomenon called variable rewards.

Saying “you may” instead of “you must” Twitter did something particularly interesting with the release. Rather than simply forcing people to switch to the new interface when they were selected, they gave everyone the option to stick with the old design if they wanted to. Giving users the power to choose changes the tone of their response. When forced to change, people often react negatively. Allow people to change on their own schedule, and you empower them, diffusing animosity. We’d all rather hear “You may...” instead of

These letters put a human face on the Wufoo brand. Their surprise arrival triggers a warm response from recipients who feel special in the eyes of the people at Wufoo. That feeling in turn triggers one consistent behavior—a web-wide broadcast to anyone who will listen. Though not meant as a marketing ploy, these letters steadily stream through Twitter, Facebook, and Flickr, making a lasting impression on people who are not yet customers, but who are much more likely to become customers because of the personal attention they see their friends receiving.

Have you ever noticed that hearing your favorite song on the radio seems so much more enjoyable than when you play it yourself? Surprise amplifies our emotional response. When we anticipate a moment, the emotional response is diluted across time. A moment of surprise compresses emotion into a split second, making our reaction more intense, and creating a strong imprint on our memory

Photo cropping shapes the audience’s emotional perspective. The face-ism ratio design principle states that photographs cropped tight to the subject’s face encourage an emotional response from the viewer, while emphasizing the personality of the subject. Wider subject cropping emphasizes the physical appearance of the subject.

MailChimp uses contractions like “don’t” instead of “do not” because that’s how real humans speak to one another. MailChimp uses sound effects like, “hmmmmm....” to make it sound like you’re thinking hard, or “Blech, that’s awful!” to communicate empathy. Lowercase form and button text reinforce the brand’s informality.

Emotional design’s primary goal is to facilitate human-to-human communication.

We perceive contrast in a couple of ways:

Visual contrast: difference in shape, color, form, etc.
Cognitive contrast: difference in experiences or memories

The inspiration for our color palette came from our competitors. It was really depressing to see so much software designed to remind people they’re making databases in a windowless office, and so we immediately knew we wanted to go in the opposite direction.

---

We want our work to stand out from the rest. We want people to have such a great experience that they feel the need to talk about it to everyone. We want what we make to be remarkable.

While big-box stores proliferate disposable mass-market goods, websites like Etsy and Kickstarter are empowering artists, craftspeople, and DIY inventors who sell goods they’ve designed and created. And their customers love the experience. When you buy from an independent craftsman, you support creative thinking and families (not corporations), and you gain the opportunity to live with an object that has a story. That feels good.
