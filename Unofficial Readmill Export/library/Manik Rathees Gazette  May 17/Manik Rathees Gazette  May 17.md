Chicago has a very practical, Midwestern feel...People aren't chasing fame or those kinds of artificial things. Instead, people are trying to build solid, sustainable things and I think that has a big impact on me.

We've grown slowly over 14 years. If you bring on a couple great people at a time, I think you can grow a much larger company and maintain a culture, but you have to do it carefully, slowly, and thoughtfully along the way. People need time to understand the culture and become assimilated into it; you want them to feel part of it, instead of just floating on top of it.

"I'd like to give back as much as I can, but I don't just want to give something to say I'm giving back. I really want to figure out what it is that I can help with in a much bigger way."

I'm more of a fan of constant, steady growth because it feels more sustainable over a long period of time. Creating things that are lasting is what great cultures do. When you travel in Europe and see structures that have been around for hundreds of years, you think, "This culture cared to make something that would last forever." What are we creating today that's going to last for 20, 50, or 100 years?

The other advice is to focus on one thing. I see a lot of entrepreneurs build something and then move onto the next thing and the next thing and the next. Building something is only step one. It's not that hard to put something out there. Building on top of that to maintain and improve it is actually the harder thing to do. Anyone can release something, but it's much harder to polish and refine it over time once it's out there.

"I think obscurity is your friend when you're just starting out. People want to get rid of the obscurity so everyone knows who they are and what they're doing, but it's nice to have that cushion of being able to mess up without anyone knowing or caring..."

If people pay $20, they should get at least $21 worth of value out of what they buy.

"It's not about the money; it's about the fact that I can make something that's more valuable than the money people pay for it...people are going to trade their money for what I'm giving them and I want to give them more than what they're paying for."

This guy asked me to come work for him as a web designer in San Diego, so I said yes. I did that for three or four months before I realized that I'm not built to work for other people. I love working with people, but I need to run my own thing.
