I don’t micro-manage. If you’ve got someone like Jason Santa Maria working for you, you don’t need to breathe down his neck and tell him how to design a page. I think a lot of it for me is just finding people who are better than ￼me at everything that I do, and then delegating to them.

find a voice and a passion, and establish yourself not just as a designer, but as someone who’s a design leader.
