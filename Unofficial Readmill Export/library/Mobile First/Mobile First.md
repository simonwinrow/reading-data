**Mobile First** by *Luke Wroblewski*

To illustrate, let’s imagine we need someone to provide his or her email address at me.com. We can use an input mask to “mask” or cover over anything that isn’t part of the format we require. In this case, the email address we collect has to end in “@me.com” so we can mask any characters that are entered after the “@” to make sure a me.com email address is provided.

For starters, several new HTML5 input types can help people accurately answer questions that require a specific format. On a mobile browser like Safari, specifying an input of type url brings up a virtual alphanumeric keyboard with “.”, “/”, and “.com” keys. Specifying an input of type email brings up a virtual alphanumeric keyboard with “.” and “@” keys. And specifying an input of type number brings up a virtual numeric keyboard (fig 6.10).

There are, however, ways to mitigate things so that labels within input fields work better. The mobile sign-in screen for the project management application Basecamp keeps labels within input fields visible until someone actually begins to enter an answer. (This requires some development work as it currently isn’t default web browser behavior.) Basecamp also makes a stronger visual distinction between answers and labels so the two are less likely to be confused (fig 6.3). Fig 6.3: 37signal’s Basecamp has put in some extra work to make labels within input fields better in their sign-in form.

did you know that 16% of new Twitter users in a five-month period during 2010 signed up through mobile (http://bkaprt.com/mf/25)? And 40% of all tweets come from a mobile device (http://bkaprt.com/mf/50)? Still don’t think input on mobile matters?

Most importantly, though, we need to stop assuming that people won’t do things just because they are on their mobile devices. After all, someone bought a $265,000 plane using eBay’s iPhone app (http://bkaprt.com/mf/48, http://bkaprt.com/mf/49)!

After all, over four billion text messages were sent per day in the United States in 2010—many of them through painful feature phone keypads. Clearly people want to message each other using their mobiles—a lot. And they are willing to endure hardship to do it.

At this point we’ve talked about reasons for designing and developing web experiences for mobile first. A mobile first approach: Prepares you for the explosive growth and new opportunities emerging on mobile today. Forces you to focus and prioritize your products by embracing the constraints inherent in mobile design. Allows you to deliver innovative experiences by building on new capabilities native to mobile devices.

If you design for mobile first, you can create agreement up front on what matters most. You can then apply the same rationale to the desktop (and any other) experience of your web product. If you can agree on the most important set of features and content for your customers and business, why should that prioritization change with more screen space?

Traffic to mobile websites in 2010 grew 600% after tripling between 2009 and 2010 (http://bkaprt.com/mf/7).

Here’s the elevator pitch: designing for mobile first not only prepares you for the explosive growth and new opportunities on the mobile internet, it forces you to focus and enables you to innovate in ways you previously couldn’t

And Kevin Lynch, Adobe’s CTO, states: “We really need to shift to think about mobile first....This is a bigger shift than we saw with the personal computing revolution,” (http://bkaprt.com/mf/3).

This book is really just a small, simple idea. But like many other simple ideas before it, this idea has deep and far-reaching implications. It changes how we define the personal computer and how we use the web. While that’s a very big deal, it can be boiled down to how we get started.
