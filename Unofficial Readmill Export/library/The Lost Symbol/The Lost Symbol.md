**The Lost Symbol** by *Dan Brown*

Exactly! Langdon had never understood why the very first passages of the Bible referred to God as a plural being. Elohim. The Almighty God in Genesis was described not as One . . . but as Many. ?God is plural,? Katherine whispered, ?because the minds of man are plural.? Langdon?s thoughts were spiraling now . . . dreams, memories, hopes, fears, revelations . . . all swirling above him in the Rotunda dome. As his eyes began to close again, he found himself staring at three words in Latin, painted within the Apotheosis. E PLURIBUS UNUM. ?Out of many, one,? he thought, slipping off into sleep.

?Then don?t think of it as faith. Think of it simply as changing your perspective, accepting that the world is not precisely as you imagine. Historically, every major scientific breakthrough began with a simple idea that threatened to overturn all of our beliefs. The simple statement ?the earth is round? was mocked as utterly impossible because most people believed the oceans would flow off the planet. Heliocentricity was called heresy. Small minds have always lashed out at what they don?t understand. There are those who create . . . and those who tear down. That dynamic has existed for all time. But eventually the creators find believers, and the number of believers reaches a critical mass, and suddenly the world becomes round, or the solar system becomes heliocentric. Perception is transformed, and a new reality is born.?

A wise man once told me,? Peter said, his voice faint now, ?the only difference between you and God is that you have forgotten you are divine.?

Sin-cere. Since the days of Michelangelo, sculptors had been hiding the flaws in their work by smearing hot wax into the cracks and then dabbing the wax with stone dust. The method was considered cheating, and therefore, any sculpture ?without wax??literally sine cera?was considered a ?sincere? piece of art. The phrase stuck. To this day we still sign our letters ?sincerely? as a promise that we have written ?without wax? and that our words are true.

The well-trained mind, Galloway thought, hiding a smile. How do you think Jesus healed the sick? ?I realize,? Katherine said, ?that modern medicine ridicules healers and shamans, but I saw this with my own eyes. My CCD cameras clearly photographed this man transmitting a massive energy field from his fingertips . . . and literally changing the cellular makeup of his patient. If that?s not godlike power, then I don?t know what is.?

The religion of thefuture, Einstein had predicted, will be a cosmic religion. It will transcend personal God and avoid dogmaand theology.

The ?sanctum sanctorum,? as Mal?akh liked to call it, was a perfect twelve-foot square. Twelve are the signsof the zodiac. Twelve are the hours of the day. Twelve are the gates of heaven. In the center of the chamber was a stone table, a seven-by-seven square. Seven are the seals of Revelation. Seven are the steps of theTemple.

The George Washington Masonic Memorial stands atop Shuter?s Hill in Alexandria, Virginia. Built in three distinct tiers of increasing architectural complexity from bottom to top?Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian?the structure stands as a physical symbol of man?s intellectual ascent. Inspired by the ancient Pharos lighthouse of Alexandria, Egypt, this soaring tower is capped by an Egyptian pyramid with a flamelike finial.

You?re preaching to the choir, Langdon thought, having learned the lesson firsthand in Paris a number of years back. SanGreal: Holy Grail. SangReal: Royal Blood.

Like most teachers, Langdon did not enjoy being lectured to. The Moses above them had horns for the same reason thousands of Christian images of Moses had horns?a mistranslation of the book of Exodus. The original Hebrew text described Moses as having ?karan ?ohr panav? ??facial skin that glowed with rays of light??but when the Roman Catholic Church created the official Latin translation of the Bible, the translator bungled Moses?s description, rendering it as ?cornuta esset facies sua,? meaning ?his face was horned.? From that moment on, artists and sculptors, fearing reprisals if they were not true to the Gospels, began depicting Moses with horns. ?It was a simple mistake,? Langdon replied. ?A mistranslation by Saint Jerome around four hundred A.D.? Bellamy looked impressed. ?Exactly. A mistranslation. And the result is . . . poor Moses is now misshapen for all history.?

Because most Christians want it both ways. They want to be able to proudly declare they are believers in the Bible and yet simply ignore those parts they find too difficult or too inconvenient to believe.

The idea of ?order from chaos? was one of the great Masonic axioms. Ordo abchao

Human thought can literally transform the physical world.

Even the crystalline structure of a newly forming solid was rendered mutable by one?s mind; Katherine had created beautifully symmetrical ice crystals by sending loving thoughts to a glass of water as it froze. Incredibly, the converse was also true: when she sent negative, polluting thoughts to the water, the ice crystals froze in chaotic, fractured forms.

The shocking discovery, it seemed, paralleled the ancient spiritual belief in a ?cosmic consciousness??a vast coalescing of human intention that was actually capable of interacting with physical matter.

In 2001, in the hours following the horrifying events of September 11, the field of Noetic Science made a quantum leap forward. Four scientists discovered that as the frightened world came together and focused in shared grief on this single tragedy, the outputs of thirty-seven different Random Event Generators around the world suddenly became significantly less random. Somehow, the oneness of this shared experience, the coalescing of millions of minds, had affected the randomizing function of these machines, organizing their outputs and bringing order from chaos.
